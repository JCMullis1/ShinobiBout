A project that I am working on, I don't think it'll be much but it's just to experiment and learn Python better, just looking for advice on how i could've done better..

The main objective is that in the game you input your player name your element and your health, and you also select your enemies stuff in the same way

then each turn it's similar to rock paper scissors with the elements and the objective is to get one player's health to hit 0

the program ends when that goal is reached and through the terminal the print statements will show you your and your enemy's health along with which element they picked

It's just poorly made so i wanted some advice
